# DONE! Add logging so it can provide feedback
# DONE! Put it in a loop so it runs indefinitly? Not sure if we want that and a time.sleep() or we rather launch it every X minutes like with cron
# DONE! Try/except in case reddit is down
# TODO: Check what happens if I get back 2 results when searching for a movie. Maybe I get a normal and HD version and all hell breaks loose?
