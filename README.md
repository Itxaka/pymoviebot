pymoviebot.py
--------------

pymoviebot is a bot for reddit. It will keep checking the subreddit /r/fullmovierequest for movie requests. 
On a new request it will check the sqlite databse created from /r/fullmoviesonyoutube and /r/fullmoviesonvimeo 
and if something is found it will post the correct link to the post.


How it works
-------------

database.py will crawl both subreddits and store into a sqlite database the whole thing. post ID, title, url,
reddit url and post author is stored. 
The sqlite database provides us with a quick and small response for any query we do, much better than searching
both subreddits everytime there is a new request.

pymoviebot.py will check the request subreddit every 5 minutes and get the 10 newests post. Then it will check if they 
are already fulfilled and commented by itself and if not, check and post if there is any coincidence in the database.

It will also flair the post automatically with the proper flair.

TODOs
------

* Use more try/Except to catch more exceptions, in case reddit is down for example.
* Check what happens if the search answers 2 rows of data, like a movie and his HD counterpart. Im guessing nothing happens,
  it tries to post the links again but the bot check that he has commented already so it ignores it.
